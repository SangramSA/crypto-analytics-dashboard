## 🏗️ Architecture

The platform uses a scalable, event-driven architecture on AWS to ensure low latency and high availability, from ingestion to visualization.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* An AWS Account with appropriate permissions
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) v1.0+
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.9+

### 1. Local Development Setup

Set up and run the environment locally for testing and development.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/crypto-analytics-dashboard.git](https://github.com/your-username/crypto-analytics-dashboard.git)
cd crypto-analytics-dashboard

# Set up environment variables
# This file contains credentials and configurations for the services.
cp .env.example .env
nano .env # Edit with your AWS credentials and custom configuration

# Start the local stack (if applicable for local testing)
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Production Deployment

Deploy the full infrastructure to your AWS account using Terraform.

```bash
# Navigate to the Terraform directory
cd infrastructure/terraform

# Initialize Terraform and review the deployment plan
terraform init
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration to deploy the infrastructure
terraform apply

# Deploy the Lambda functions using the provided script
./infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh

# Start the Kinesis data producer to begin ingestion
python src/ingestion/producers/kinesis_producer.py
```
